I havade one mixin for the 3 lines of the box-shadow styling.
the general padding the same everywhere with one variable. (red=16px, blue=8px), 
the footer h6 have double the padding of the other elements.I have Use "operations" to do this.

I have Nested the styling rules of grouped elements, like the sections in the Article.

I have made use of extend to re-use the same CSS for the "success", "error" and "warning" messages.

In the HTML, there are 2 links called "blue" & "red".
Clicking one of the 2 links should change the text to red/blue
